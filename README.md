TigerTix is a fully-featured event ticketing and registration system, using Next.js, Auth0, TailwindCSS, and C#. This project was developed as part of Clemson's Software Engineering Course, as a semester-long collaboration. TigerTix allows users to view (fictitious) events on campus and register to attend them. On the backend, it allows artists to post and manage events, to understand registration, communicate with their event attendees, and more.
